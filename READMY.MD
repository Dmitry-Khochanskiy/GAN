# Simple Generative-Adversary network in torch
An implemintation of GAN as described in https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html. It was tested on WIN 10 with Nvidia GeForce GTC 1660 and RTX 3050.

# Prerequisites
Anaconda, CUDA
Env can be loaded from pytorchenv.yml

# Usage
It can run from notebooks

# Data set for training
[Colorectal Histology MNIST (https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist)]

# To do
- [ ] Test and expand generation notebook
- [ ] Implement more novel GAN algorithm
